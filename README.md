### Example Code Snippets

#### Fetching Park Data

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

async function fetchParkData() {
  const response = await axios.get(`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}/parks`);
  return response.data;
}

fetchParkData().then(data => console.log(data));
```

#### Authenticating a User

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

async function authenticateUser(username, password) {
  const response = await axios.post(`${process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH_BASE_URL}/login`, { username, password });
  return response.data;
}

authenticateUser('user123', 'password123').then(data => console.log(data));
```
